# Navi-DiscordBotProject

A discord bot with several little fun features for my personal discord server.
based on Node.js & Discord.js, entirely written in Korean.

* Meal Recommend feature : 
the Food list can be updated freely within Discord, by everyone.
No more worries about your next lunch.

* Russian Roulette game : 
idk but it sounds fun, so I made it. 
Russian Roulette game can be played solo, or together upto 6 people.
(with 100% shot guarantee Semi-Automatic Pistol mode)
